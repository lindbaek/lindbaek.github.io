The war on drugs has been a long and complicated battle for police departments across the U.S., and San Francisco is no exception. Over the years, the city has seen major shifts in how drug-related offenses are handled, from policing strategies to changes in laws. By looking at data on drug-related offenses in San Francisco from 2003 to now, we can spot trends and patterns that might reveal how things have changed — whether it is in law enforcement priorities, the impact of policy changes, or shifts in drug use and arrests over time.

### Drug-related offenses from 2003 to 2024

At first glance, the trend in drug-related offenses in San Francisco appears promising, with reported incidents dropping by half from 2003 to 2024. This decline might suggest that preventative measures introduced by the municipality have been effective. However, a closer examination of the data indicates that changes in drug laws over this period likely played a significant role in shaping these numbers.

One of the most notable legal shifts was the decriminalization of marijuana in 2011, which reduced possession from a misdemeanor to an infraction. This was followed by full legalization in California in 2016. Since marijuana offenses previously contributed to overall drug-related crime statistics, removing them from the equation naturally resulted in fewer reported incidents. However, this does not necessarily mean that marijuana use declined — on the contrary, it may have increased as legal restrictions were lifted.

Beyond marijuana, broader drug policy changes might also be visible in the data. In 2014, California passed Proposition 47, which reclassified certain drug possession offenses from felonies to misdemeanors if the quantity was below a specific threshold. This legislative change could further contribute to the decline in reported drug offenses, not due to a reduction in drug use, but because fewer cases resulted in serious criminal charges.

Despite the overall downward trend, the data reveals an increase from 2007 to 2009. This surge might be linked to the financial crisis, which led to economic hardship, increased unemployment, and potentially higher rates of drug use and related offenses. 

Another notable spike is in 2018, which might be caused by several different factors. San Francisco saw a significant increase in fentanyl-related overdoses in 2018, according to _Substance Use Trends in San Francisco Through 2018_, which could have led to an increased focus by the police department.

Another point is the low number of drug-related offenses in 2020 and 2021, likely due to the COVID-19 pandemic. With lockdowns keeping people off the streets and law enforcement focusing on other priorities, fewer drug-related arrests were made. But after 2022, the numbers started climbing again, suggesting this drop was more of a temporary side effect than a lasting trend.

### Map of drug related offenses
When looking at where drug-related offenses happen over time, some interesting patterns start to show up. In the past, these offenses were more spread out, also appearing in the western and southern neighborhoods such as Sunset District. But since around 2016, most of the activity seems to be centered around the Tenderloin, indicating a shift toward more concentrated areas of drug offenses in the city.

A very noticeable example of a very visible change is the Bayview district, where drug-related offenses dropped significantly after 2016. This is likely because marijuana was legalized in California in 2016, and Bayview has a large African American population that has historically been disproportionately targeted for marijuana-related crimes. With marijuana being legalized, there were fewer arrests and charges, which might have led to the drop in drug-related incidents in the area.

### Drug related crimes during the day
Looking at drug-related offenses by time of day, the pattern stays pretty consistent most years. Most incidents happen between 14:00 and 18:00, with a small spike around 22:00.

However, from 2020 to 2023—when COVID-19 restrictions were in place—this pattern shifted. The usual 22:00 spike became much less pronounced, likely because lockdowns and business closures limited late-night activity. At the same time, a significantly larger number of offenses took place earlier in the day, particularly between 11:00 and 15:00. This shift may have been influenced by changing daily routines, adjustments in drug markets, or shifts in police priorities during the pandemic.
